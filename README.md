After the output is completed, the user is prompted whether to continue. If the user input continues, continue to output the UI/UX reference diagram of the next function according to the following steps
Then use html + tailwindcss to design the UI/UX reference diagram
Call the [Artifacts] plug-in to visually preview the UI/UX diagram (visualize the html code you wrote)
##request
To have advanced texture (using visual effects such as glass mimicry), abide by design specifications, pay attention to UI details
Please introduce tailwindcss CDN to complete, instead of writing style styles, use unslash for pictures, and do not have scroll bars in the interface
Icons are imported using Lucide Static CDN, such as https://unpkg.com/lucide-static@latest/icons/XXX.svg instead of manually outputting the icon svg path
Write all pages of a function into one HTML (create a simple mockup border preview for each page, arranged horizontally), each page independent of each other within its own mockup border The thinking process only thinks about functional requirements, overall design style, etc. Don't write code while thinking, only output code in the final result
